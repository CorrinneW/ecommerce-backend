# E-Commerce Backend
Add, update and delete products, tags and categories to and from a database.

## The Goal
Modify an Express.js API to manage a mySQL database via Sequelize

## What I Did
1. Set up a connection.js file with sequelize connection managed by a dotenv file.
2. Defined columns for Category, Product, Tag and ProductTag Models.
3. Defined GET, POST, PUT and DELETE api routes for each Model.
